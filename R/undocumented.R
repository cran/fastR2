#' Undocumented functions
#' 
#' These objects are undocumented.  
#' 
# In many cases, these are depricated in favor of alternative
# methods (often in the \code{mosaic} package) to obtain the same results but remain in 
# the package to avoid breaking code used in Foundations and Applications of Statistics, the 
# book associated with this package.
# For example, \code{funplot}, should be replaced by \code{plotFun} and 
# \code{pdfplot}, \code{pmfhistogram}, and \code{pmfplot} should be replaced by 
# \code{plotDist}.
#' 
#' Some are left-overs from a previous version of the book and package.
#' In other cases, the functions are of limited suitability for general use.
